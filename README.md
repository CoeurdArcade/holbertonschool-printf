Building this project recquires with teammates recquires to have primary workflows like:

Approaching a project, group projects, how to pair programming, flowcharts

A readme file at the root folder of the project

Betty style code

Not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

No use of main.c

The prototypes of all the functions should be included in the header file called main.h

All the header files should be include guarded

Build a putchar function for the project
