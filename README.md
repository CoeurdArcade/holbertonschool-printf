Description

_printf is a simplified version of the standard library function printf in C. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it ideal for educational purposes or for use in simple embedded systems.

Here are some of its key features:

Prints strings and characters to stdout: _printf allows you to print strings and characters to the standard output, which is usually the console or terminal.

Supports basic format specifiers: It supports the basic format specifiers that are commonly used in C programming. These include %c for characters, %s for strings, %d and %i for integers, and %% for printing the '%' character itself.

Easy integration: _printf can be easily integrated into any C project. You just need to include the header file and the source file in your project, and you're good to go.

Demonstrates the use of variadic functions and parsing format specifiers: One of the main educational benefits of _printf is that it demonstrates how to use variadic functions in C. These are functions that take a variable number of arguments. It also shows how to parse format specifiers, which are the placeholders in the format string that tell the function what type of data to expect

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need a C compiler. Here's how to install the GCC compiler on Ubuntu :

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc

To use this project in your own code, follow these steps:

Download _printf: You can download the _printf source code from the GitHub repository using one of the following methods:

Clone the repository: If you have Git installed on your computer, you can clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/evrade10/holbertonschool-printf.git

Downloading the source code: If you don't want to clone the repository, you can download the source code as a ZIP file by clicking on the "Code" button on the repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".

include _printf in your project: Once you have downloaded the source code, you need to add the following files to your project:

_printf.c : The source file containing the implementation of the _printf function.

main.h: The header file containing the declaration of the _printf function.

_char.c, _int.c, _string.c, itoa.c : The source files containing the helper functions used by _printf.

Compile your project: Once you have added the necessary files to your project, you can use the _printf function in your code. To do this, you need to include the main.h header file in your source files where you want to use the _printf function.
