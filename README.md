Description 

_printf is a simplified version of the standard library function printf in C. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it ideal for educational purposes or for use in simple embedded systems.

Here are some of its key features:

Prints strings and characters to stdout: _printf allows you to print strings and characters to the standard output, which is usually the console or terminal.

Supports basic format specifiers: It supports the basic format specifiers that are commonly used in C programming. These include %c for characters, %s for strings, %d and %i for integers, and %% for printing the '%' character itself.

Easy integration: _printf can be easily integrated into any C project. You just need to include the header file and the source file in your project, and you're good to go.

Demonstrates the use of variadic functions and parsing format specifiers: One of the main educational benefits of _printf is that it demonstrates how to use variadic functions in C. These are functions that take a variable number of arguments. It also shows how to parse format specifiers, which are the placeholders in the format string that tell the function what type of data to expect

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need a C compiler. Here's how to install the GCC compiler on Ubuntu :
